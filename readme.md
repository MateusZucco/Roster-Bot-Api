## Description
  This is the back-end of the Roster Bot, my undergraduate thesis for IFRS that I created a Telegram chatbot with the purpose of helping users when they need manage a roster.
  
  In this repository you will find a REST API, built with Node.js, Express, Sequelize and PostgreSQL, with the main objective of serving list and item management routes to the Roster-Bot, in addition to registering users through the Roster-Bot-Website.
